In tools and when compressing large inputs in one call, consider using
        $OodleXLZ_Compress_AsyncAndWait (in the Oodle2 Ext lib) instead to get parallelism. Alternatively,
        chop the data into small fixed size chunks (we recommend at least 256KiB, i.e. 262144 bytes) and
        call compress on each of them, which decreases compression ratio but makes for trivial parallel
        compression and decompression.
